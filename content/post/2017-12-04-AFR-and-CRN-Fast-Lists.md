Cevo are delighted to have been awarded second place in the CRN Fast50 and 40th in the Financial Review Fast Starters for 2017. 

The former, announced last week, places us amongst the fastest growing IT solution providers in Australia.  

CRN’s Editorial Director, Steven Kiernan commented <i>"Every year the [CRN Fast50] (https://www.crn.com.au/fast50/winners.aspx) gets more competitive. This is the ninth year of the awards since we launched the program back in 2009, and it was the fastest year yet. The average growth rate was 85.9 percent! It was an incredible achievement by all of the companies that secured a place in the 2017 CRN Fast50."</i>

This capped off a stellar month that also saw us in the [Financial Review Fast Starters] (http://www.afr.com/leadership/afr-lists/fast-starters/financial-review-fast-starters-2017-the-full-list-20171103-gzeezw), (featuring the fastest growing companies across the board in Australia). Needless to say, we are honoured to be one of, and amongst, some of the who’s who of organisations making big waves.

<i>“We are really thrilled”</i> says Hannah Browne, General Manager of Cevo.
<i>“Being part of not one, but two of the ‘Fast’ lists is huge recognition of the sustained energy and efforts of the entire Cevo team. Our incredible, progressive clients are driving exciting change agendas that are shifting the way organisations look at technology, innovation and people. It's pretty amazing to be building a mission-based business that supports and accelerates this, and to appear in these lists after only two years is a fantastic achievement that we are all immensely proud of.”</i>
